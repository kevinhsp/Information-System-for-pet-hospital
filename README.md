# information-system-for-pet-hospital---SQL
Our final project focuses on building information system for the local reputational pet hospital, it plans to expand the business recently due to the increase number of sales and customers. Their current main processes are as follows:
*Record new customers’ information into the system
*Matching available doctors with customer’s request
*Doctors start to provide treatment at scheduled time
*Manually record the next follow-up date
*Correct matches the billing and payment information
As our team’s goal is to optimize their current process, therefore we generate several reports to help our client better control the whole process. What is more, in this report, we will analyze each report’s business values in order to better serve the client needs.
